actor Student as S
participant "Gazebo Simulator" as G
participant "LiDAR Sensor Model" as L
participant "Camera Sensor Model" as C
participant "IMU Sensor Model" as I
participant "ROS 2 Bridge" as ROS
participant "Sensor Processing Nodes" as SPN
participant "RViz Visualization" as RViz
participant "Validation Tools" as VT

S --> G: Configure robot with sensors
G --> L: Simulate LiDAR rays
G --> C: Simulate camera images
G --> I: Simulate IMU measurements
L --> ROS: Publish LaserScan
C --> ROS: Publish Image/Depth
I --> ROS: Publish IMU data
ROS --> SPN: Send sensor data
SPN --> RViz: Forward to visualization
SPN --> VT: Send to validation tools

note right: Sensor simulation pipeline\nsimulates realistic sensor\nbehavior in a virtual environment\nfor testing perception algorithms
