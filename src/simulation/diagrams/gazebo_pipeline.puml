title Gazebo Simulation Pipeline Architecture

actor Student as S
participant "Gazebo Simulator" as G
participant "Robot Model (URDF)" as R
participant "Sensors (LiDAR, Camera, IMU)" as Sen
participant "ROS 2 Bridge" as ROS
participant "RViz Visualization" as RViz

S --> G: Launch simulation
G --> R: Load robot model
R --> Sen: Attach sensors
Sen --> ROS: Publish sensor data
ROS --> RViz: Send data for visualization
ROS --> G: Send control commands

note right: Student interacts with\nsimulation through ROS 2\nmessages and can visualize\nsensor data in RViz
