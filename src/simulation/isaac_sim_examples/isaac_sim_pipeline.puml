actor Student as S
participant "Isaac Sim" as IS
participant "Humanoid Robot Model" as HRM
participant "Isaac ROS Bridge" as IRB
participant "Perception Pipeline" as PP

participant "VSLAM Module" as VSLAM

S --> IS: Load humanoid scene
IS --> HRM: Instantiate robot model
HRM --> IRB: Connect to ROS bridge
IRB --> PP: Send sensor data
PP --> VSLAM: Process visual data
IRB --> SDG: Generate synthetic data
SDG --> S: Output training data

note right: Isaac Sim provides\nphotorealistic simulation\nwith hardware-accelerated\nperception through Isaac ROS
