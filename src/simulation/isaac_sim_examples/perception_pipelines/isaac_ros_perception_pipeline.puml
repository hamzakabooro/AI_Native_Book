S --> CS: Capture visual data
CS --> IP: Raw image data
IP --> FD: Rectified images
FD --> VSLAM: Detected features
FD --> OD: Image features
VSLAM --> SF: Pose estimates
OD --> SF: Object detections
SF --> NS: Fused perception data
SF --> IRB: Publish ROS messages
IRB --> S: Provide perception results

note right: Isaac ROS perception pipeline\naccelerates visual processing\nusing NVIDIA GPUs
