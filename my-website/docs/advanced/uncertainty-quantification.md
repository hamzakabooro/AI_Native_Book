# Uncertainty Quantification in Physical AI

This chapter addresses how to quantify and propagate uncertainty in Physical AI systems, ensuring reliable predictions even when models, data, or environmental conditions have inherent uncertainties.

## Key Concepts

- Aleatoric vs epistemic uncertainty
- Bayesian neural networks for physics
- Gaussian processes with physical constraints
- Propagation of uncertainty through physical models
- Calibration of physical AI systems
- Sensitivity analysis in physical models

## Approaches to Uncertainty Integration

- Variational inference in physical neural networks
- Monte Carlo dropout for uncertainty estimation
- Ensemble methods for physical systems
- Conformal prediction for physics problems
- Active learning in physical domains

## Applications

Uncertainty quantification is crucial for:
- Safety-critical systems (aerospace, medical devices)
- Scientific modeling and discovery
- Model validation and verification
- Decision-making under uncertainty
- Experimental design optimization

## Learning Objectives

After completing this chapter, you will:
- Understand different types of uncertainty in physical AI
