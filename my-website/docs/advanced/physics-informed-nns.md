# Physics-Informed Neural Networks

Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are a powerful framework for solving and learning physics equations directly from data while enforcing physical laws as hard constraints. This chapter provides a comprehensive overview of PINN theory and applications.

## Theoretical Foundation

- Formulation of PINNs for PDEs
- Automatic differentiation in physics constraints
- Weighting of data versus physics losses
- Boundary and initial condition incorporation
- Multi-fidelity learning with PINNs

## Implementation Strategies

- Network architecture selection
- Loss function design
- Adaptive sampling strategies
- Multi-scale PINNs
- Domain decomposition approaches
- Uncertainty quantification in PINNs

## Applications and Limitations

PINNs have been successfully applied to:
- Fluid dynamics
- Solid mechanics
- Heat transfer
- Electromagnetics
- Quantum mechanics

But face challenges with:
- Complex geometries
- Stiff equations
- Multi-scale problems
- Training convergence
