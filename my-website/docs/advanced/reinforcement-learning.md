# Physics-Based Reinforcement Learning

This chapter explores how physical principles can guide reinforcement learning algorithms, leading to more sample-efficient and physically consistent policies, especially important in real-world applications.

## Integration Approaches

- Physics-informed reward design
- Simulation-to-reality transfer (sim-to-real)
- Learning dynamics models for model-based RL
- Physics-aware exploration strategies
- Constrained reinforcement learning
- Incorporating conservation laws in RL

## Applications in Physical Systems

Physics-guided RL is valuable for:
- Robot control and manipulation
- Autonomous vehicles
- Control of physical systems (power grids, chemical plants)
- Scientific discovery and experimentation
- Optimal control of dynamical systems

## Challenges and Solutions

Key challenges include:
- Reality gap between simulation and real world
- Safety constraints during learning
- Sample efficiency in complex physical environments
- Transferability across different physical systems

## Learning Objectives

After completing this chapter, you will:
- Understand how to incorporate physics into RL formulations
- Know approaches for sim-to-real transfer
- Be familiar with safe RL in physical systems
- Understand the benefits of physics-aware RL approaches
