# Learning Partial Differential Equations

This chapter explores advanced techniques for learning partial differential equations (PDEs) from data, a crucial capability for modeling complex physical systems with spatial and temporal dynamics.

## Key Methods

- Discovery of PDEs from observational data
- Learning solution operators for PDEs
- Physics-informed neural networks for PDEs
- Operator learning with neural networks
- Mesh-free approaches to PDE solving
- Learning physics from images or sensor data

## Challenges in PDE Learning

Learning PDEs presents unique challenges:
- Curse of dimensionality in spatial domains
- Need for large amounts of high-quality data
- Numerical stability of learned discretizations
- Ensuring well-posedness of learned equations
- Scalability to complex multi-physics systems

## Learning Objectives

After completing this chapter, you will:
- Understand different approaches to learning PDEs
- Know how to implement physics-informed neural networks for PDEs
- Be familiar with operator learning techniques
- Understand the challenges in learning PDEs from data
