# Physics Fundamentals

This chapter covers the essential physics concepts that are crucial for understanding physical AI engineering. We'll explore the fundamental laws and principles that govern the behavior of physical systems, which form the foundation for integrating AI with physics-based models.

## Key Topics

- Classical mechanics and Newton's laws
- Conservation laws (energy, momentum, angular momentum)
- Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics
- Electromagnetism basics
- Thermodynamics principles
- Wave mechanics and oscillations
- Continuum mechanics
- Statistical mechanics

## Why Physics Matters in AI

Understanding physics is essential for developing AI systems that interact with the real world. Physical principles provide constraints and governing equations that help AI models understand and predict real-world phenomena. This knowledge is particularly crucial in fields like robotics, autonomous systems, and scientific computing.
