# AI Fundamentals

This chapter introduces the core concepts of artificial intelligence that are particularly relevant to physical AI engineering. We'll review machine learning fundamentals with a focus on how they apply to modeling physical systems.

## Key Topics

- Supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning
- Neural networks and deep learning
- Optimization algorithms
- Probabilistic models
- Graph neural networks
- Attention mechanisms
- Autoencoders and generative models

## AI for Physical Systems

Traditional AI approaches often treat systems as black boxes, learning input-output relationships without understanding the underlying physics. In physical AI engineering, we combine the learning capabilities of AI with the interpretability and generalization of physical laws.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this chapter, you will:
- Understand core AI and machine learning concepts
- Recognize the strengths and limitations of different AI approaches
- Know how to select appropriate AI methods for physical problems
- Appreciate the challenges of applying standard AI to physical systems
