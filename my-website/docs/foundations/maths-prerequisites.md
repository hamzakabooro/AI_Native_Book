# Mathematical Prerequisites

This chapter covers the essential mathematical concepts needed for understanding and implementing Physical AI Engineering. These mathematical tools form the language in which both physical laws and AI algorithms are expressed.

## Key Topics

- Linear algebra (vectors, matrices, eigenvalues)
- Calculus (derivatives, integrals, multivariate calculus)
- Differential equations (ODEs and PDEs)
- Probability and statistics
- Optimization theory
- Functional analysis
- Numerical methods

## Mathematical Tools in Physical AI

Physical systems are described by mathematical equations, while AI models are mathematical functions that need to be optimized. Understanding the mathematical underpinnings of both is crucial for successfully combining them in Physical AI Engineering applications.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this chapter, you will:
- Have a solid understanding of the mathematical foundations
- Be able to formulate physical problems mathematically
- Understand how mathematical concepts apply to both physics and AI
- Be prepared for the mathematical challenges in subsequent chapters
