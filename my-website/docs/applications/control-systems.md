# Control Systems

This chapter examines how Physical AI Engineering can enhance traditional control systems by incorporating machine learning with physical principles for more robust and adaptive control.

## Key Concepts

- System identification with physical constraints
- Adaptive control using neural networks
- Optimal control with physics-based regularization
- Robust control design
- Model Predictive Control (MPC) with learned components

## Physics-Aware Control

Benefits of incorporating physics in control systems:
- Improved system stability
- Better generalization to unseen conditions
- Reduced need for system linearization
- Enhanced safety through physics constraints
- More efficient learning of control policies

## Learning Objectives

After completing this chapter, you will:
- Understand how to incorporate physics into control system design
- Know techniques for learning system dynamics with physical constraints
- Be familiar with neural network-based control approaches
- Understand the benefits of physics-aware control systems
