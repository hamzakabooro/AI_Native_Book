# Neural Ordinary Differential Equations

Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs) represent a powerful framework for modeling continuous dynamics with neural networks. This chapter explores how to use neural ODEs for physical systems that evolve continuously over time.

## Core Concepts

- Continuous-depth neural networks
- ODE solvers in backpropagation
- Adjoint sensitivity method
- Continuous normalizing flows

## Applications to Physics

Neural ODEs are particularly suited for:
- Modeling continuous physical processes
- Learning unknown dynamics from data
- Replacing traditional ODE systems with neural approximations
- Ensuring continuous-time predictions

## Physics-Specific Considerations

When applying Neural ODEs to physical systems:
- Choice of ODE solver affects energy conservation
- Numerical accuracy impacts physical law preservation
- Regularization techniques for preserving symmetries

## Learning Objectives

After completing this chapter, you will:
- Understand the mathematics behind Neural ODEs
- Know how to implement and train Neural ODE models
- Understand the advantages and limitations of Neural ODEs in physics
- Be able to apply Neural ODEs to physical problems
