# Modeling Physical Systems with AI

This chapter focuses on approaches for using AI to model physical systems. We'll explore how to encode physical laws and constraints into machine learning models to ensure they respect fundamental physical principles.

## Approaches to Physics-Based Modeling

- Data-driven discovery of governing equations
- Embedding known physics into neural networks
- Learning latent physical representations
- Symmetry-based neural networks
- Geometric deep learning for physical systems

## Conservation Laws and Symmetries

Incorporating conservation laws and symmetries into learning algorithms:
- Energy conservation in neural networks
- Momentum conservation in dynamic systems
- Symmetry-equivariant networks
- Noether's theorem in neural networks

## Learning Objectives

After completing this chapter, you will:
- Understand how to embed physical constraints in AI models
- Know how to preserve conservation laws in neural networks
- Be familiar with symmetry-aware architectures
- Understand the role of physical inductive biases in model design
