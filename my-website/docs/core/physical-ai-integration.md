# Integration of Physics and AI

This chapter explores the fundamental approaches to integrating physical principles with artificial intelligence. We'll examine various methodologies for combining the predictive power of AI with the interpretability and generalization of physical laws.

## Key Integration Approaches

- Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)
- Lagrangian Neural Networks
- Hamiltonian Neural Networks
- Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs)
- Physics-guided machine learning
- Hybrid physics-ML models

## Challenges and Opportunities

Integrating physics with AI presents both opportunities and challenges:

### Opportunities
- Improved model interpretability
- Better generalization with limited data
- Conservation of physical quantities
- Extrapolation beyond training domain

### Challenges
- Balancing flexibility and constraints
- Computational complexity
- Differentiability of physical models
- Selection of appropriate physics constraints

## Learning Objectives

After completing this chapter, you will:
- Understand different approaches to physics-AI integration
- Recognize the benefits of combining physics with AI
- Identify appropriate methods for specific problems
- Understand the trade-offs involved in constrained learning
