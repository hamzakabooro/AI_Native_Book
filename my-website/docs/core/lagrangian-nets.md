# Lagrangian Neural Networks

Lagrangian Neural Networks (LNNs) are a specialized architecture designed to learn the Lagrangian of physical systems, ensuring energy conservation and other physical properties are preserved. This chapter explores the theory and implementation of LNNs.

## Theoretical Background

- Lagrangian mechanics formulation
- Euler-Lagrange equations
- Coordinate-free learning
- Symmetry preservation

## Architecture and Implementation

- Encoding the Lagrangian in neural networks
- Automatic derivation of equations of motion
- Conservative vs non-conservative forces
- Handling constraints in Lagrangian systems

## Advantages and Limitations

LNNs offer several benefits:
- Exact energy conservation
- Coordinate-free representation
- Fewer parameters than general neural networks

But also have limitations:
- Difficulty with dissipative systems
- Complex implementation for sophisticated systems
- Limited to systems with known configuration space

## Learning Objectives

After completing this chapter, you will:
- Understand the principles of Lagrangian mechanics
- Know how to implement Lagrangian Neural Networks
- Recognize problems where LNNs are most suitable
- Understand how to handle violations of Lagrangian assumptions
